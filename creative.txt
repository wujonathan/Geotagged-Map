This website is a platform where users can add geotagged pictures to a map display. Users may submit pictures to the website which then stores information in Mysql as well as the local server. I used google maps API for ease of display of the map. 

I have two parts to my creative portion: 
1) I've implemented a function that loads a random picture.
2) I've allowed users to add optional tags to their pictures. Users may then view all events with a certain tag using the buttons located above the map.
