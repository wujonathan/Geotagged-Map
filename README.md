# Geotagged-Map
This personal project is a web application that allows users to pin pictures onto a large map. I originally worked on this to further my practice with the LAMP stack.

Users can pin pictures onto the map and comment on pictures that are already pinned. Tags can be added to the picture and filtered accordingly. My initial idea was to make a phone application but I decided to first prototype it on the web using some technology I was more familiar with.
